///   `FieldMask` represents a set of symbolic field paths, for example:
///  
///       paths: "f.a"
///       paths: "f.b.d"
///  
///   Here `f` represents a field in some root message, `a` and `b`
///   fields in the message found in `f`, and `d` a field found in the
///   message in `f.b`.
///  
///   Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be
///   returned by a get operation or modified by an update operation.
///   Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).
///  
///   # Field Masks in Projections
///  
///   When used in the context of a projection, a response message or
///   sub-message is filtered by the API to only contain those fields as
///   specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous
///   example is applied to a response message as follows:
///  
///       f {
///         a : 22
///         b {
///           d : 1
///           x : 2
///         }
///         y : 13
///       }
///       z: 8
///  
///   The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z
///   (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text
///   output):
///  
///  
///       f {
///         a : 22
///         b {
///           d : 1
///         }
///       }
///  
///   A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a
///   paths string.
///  
///   If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the
///   operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields
///   had been specified).
///  
///   Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the
///   top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the
///   field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST
///   list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message
///   in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,
///   other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be
///   clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In
///   any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required
///   behavior for APIs.
///  
///   # Field Masks in Update Operations
///  
///   A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the
///   targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
///   to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask
///   and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to
///   describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
///   fields not covered by the mask.
///  
///   If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, the existing
///   repeated values in the target resource will be overwritten by the new values.
///   Note that a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths`
///   string.
///  
///   If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for an
///   update operation, then the existing sub-message in the target resource is
///   overwritten. Given the target message:
///  
///       f {
///         b {
///           d : 1
///           x : 2
///         }
///         c : 1
///       }
///  
///   And an update message:
///  
///       f {
///         b {
///           d : 10
///         }
///       }
///  
///   then if the field mask is:
///  
///    paths: "f.b"
///  
///   then the result will be:
///  
///       f {
///         b {
///           d : 10
///         }
///         c : 1
///       }
///  
///   However, if the update mask was:
///  
///    paths: "f.b.d"
///  
///   then the result would be:
///  
///       f {
///         b {
///           d : 10
///           x : 2
///         }
///         c : 1
///       }
///  
///   In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must
///   be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.
///   Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default
///   instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do
///   not provide a mask as described below.
///  
///   If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to
///   all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).
///   Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that
///   fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into
///   the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted
///   behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify
///   a field mask, producing an error if not.
///  
///   As with get operations, the location of the resource which
///   describes the updated values in the request message depends on the
///   operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is
///   required to be honored by the API.
///  
///   ## Considerations for HTTP REST
///  
///   The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must
///   be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics
///   (PUT must only be used for full updates).
///  
///   # JSON Encoding of Field Masks
///  
///   In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are
///   separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted
///   to/from lower-camel naming conventions.
///  
///   As an example, consider the following message declarations:
///  
///       message Profile {
///         User user = 1;
///         Photo photo = 2;
///       }
///       message User {
///         string display_name = 1;
///         string address = 2;
///       }
///  
///   In proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:
///  
///       mask {
///         paths: "user.display_name"
///         paths: "photo"
///       }
///  
///   In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:
///  
///       {
///         mask: "user.displayName,photo"
///       }
///  
///   # Field Masks and Oneof Fields
///  
///   Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the
///   following message:
///  
///       message SampleMessage {
///         oneof test_oneof {
///           string name = 4;
///           SubMessage sub_message = 9;
///         }
///       }
///  
///   The field mask can be:
///  
///       mask {
///         paths: "name"
///       }
///  
///   Or:
///  
///       mask {
///         paths: "sub_message"
///       }
///  
///   Note that oneof type names ("test_oneof" in this case) cannot be used in
///   paths.
